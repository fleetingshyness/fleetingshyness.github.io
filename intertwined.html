<h2> Intertwined </h2>
<p> Darkness is like a vessel that holds me, tolerating me unconditionally without setting any barrier. Different from in the sunlit day with nowhere to hide, submerged rocks and posterns would be found here all over the night. Along with quietness, the pure and silent darkness, dry and simple, is scattered with invisible filter nets. When people make their way back home at night, the darkness would peel off their emotions which were then left dried in the air until evaporated. </p>
<p> When I was a little girl, home was like a protection cover that sheltered me from the darkness outside. I conceived that the darkness at night indicated the coming of danger, just like the complete rising of the full moon would mean the werewolf would turn into fearsome near-wolf rushing out to swallow other creatures. After entering the adulthood, I find the dark night appealing. Its unfathomable myth is like a black hole that attracts us to find out what lies in. Walking in the darkness at night, I find myself more sensitive than usual. I can hear more clearly, see more carefully, and feel the unknown world on guard.</p>
<p> However, the longer we linger in the night, the more likely we are to get lost. Coldness seeped in and our soul would even lose its way. I would naturally relax when getting used to the darkness, but when suddenly a beam of light pops up in sight, I would still quiver with inexplicable excitement. The shadow stretches when one gets closer to the light. It seems to be pulling you back, sticking to you, and inviting you to come back to the comfortable darkness with it. When I finally stand in the beam of the light and turns around, the shadow vanishes. In this portfolio, I try to explore the variety of different forms of human bodies, things and the nature with the help of light and photogram. I record the transient changes of light and shadow in a trance. As a symphony, my photo images are interwoven and combined together to produce numerous compositions.</p>
<p> Just as I squint the past, the darkness afar looks like mist with inconceivable charms. It says goodbye to me with a tender embrace. The moment in trance is as real as a dream.</p>
