<h2> We're being watched </h2>
<p>In Chiang Mai Night Safari, there lies an extensive corridor between the areas of carnivores and herbivores. Gathered in the corridor a large amount of visitors, and staffs providing paid services of taking photos, as well as food and drinks. Just at the moment I struggled out of the big crowd who were striving for photoing with the owls, I caught a glimpse of a painting at the dark corner in the neighborhood: a chimpanzee raised its mouth cunningly, sticked its tongue out and smiled wittily, with an unspeakable profundity in its look. At that instant, I could not help stiffening, falling into the thought of the observation relationship between human beings and other animals as well as everyday things. Is it not that the instant we tourists, the so-called higher animals, sit in the tour bus, turn on the headlight and light up other animals, happens to be the instant that we ourselves are exposed to the sight of other animals? They are locked in zoo, while we are restrained in the tour bus. The "observers" and "observees" are essentially of no difference when the observation takes place. When I take shots of the products of the cultural world of human beings, animal world and neighborhood, vaguely I ponder that within the process of my observation and shooting, I see myself from them. The more shots I take, the more strongly I feel about the commonality and similarity of me, and the cultural creations, other animals, etc. I hold the doubt whether these recorded people and things are objective reality, or in the form with our desire and hope blended in. The cultural creations out of religious activities are more of a worship of the power which is based off of, but has exceeded, us human beings. And the animals locked in the zoo, is seemingly the result of our domination and control over those inferior to us: we make them perform to satisfy ourselves.</p>
<p>Are the recorded purely themselves, independent beings, or is it essentially true that everyone is firmly connected, you within me and me within them? We are always acting as "observers", but is it true that long before we have played the role of "observees"? Are we looking at them, or are we essentially looking at ourselves?</p>
