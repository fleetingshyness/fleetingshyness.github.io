<h2> Yellow Memories </h2>
<p>I once worked in a market survey company before I determined to apply for an art degree, during which I was exposed to a group of statistical data that impressed me deeply: since China started the reform and opening up 40 years ago, the large-scale and rapid urbanization has promoted China's economy, alleviated the poverty degree of rural residents and contributed enormously to the urbanization of the world. From 1995 to 2000, the newly increased urban population in China accounted for 31.7 percent of the world according to the data from the United Nations. That is to say, China contributed one third of the increase in the world's urban population. Even so, economists still believe that China's urbanization level is only 60%, which needs to be improved urgently when compared to 75% of the developed countries.</p>
<p>However, when the government is vigorously promoting the urbanization and industrialization, the farmers have been less interested in becoming a citizen since 2018 according to the market survey and there is only a ratio of about 50%. More people in Zhejiang and the Pearl River delta want a rural identity rather than an urban one.</p>
<p>As for me, I grew up in an urban environment, and the city life seems to be my only choice. I'm used to tall buildings made of reinforced concrete and also the busy bazaars. My life is spent slowly with the daily vehicle noise and and the buzzling of home appliance. But every time when I listened to the father generation about their happy childhood in the mountain village, about the clouds in their hometown, the highly piled mows, the quartzite roads wetted by the morning fog, the foul-smelling fertilized fields, I was just like in another world, a dream land far away.</p>
<p>Finally after my resignation, I find a chance to go back to the land my father used to live in -- southern Anhui. When I returned to the village of the painstakingly farmers making a living from the mountain, my minds were driven by the vast sea of clouds found from the mountaintop: the urbanization and industrialization may actually increase their income and bring them more chances of development, but could we blindly pursue the economic interest at the expense of their tranquility of primitive life? Could we drive more and more people to a more and more congested civilized city, adapting to the urban rhythm and life, pursuing the same living method, facing the same way of growing, and finally turning to the similar social person under the urbanization policy? Isn't it true that a truly open and progressive society shall be more tolerant and selective to its citizens?</p>
<p>Since we are always living in urban civilization, I would like to show you another kind of primitive life through a group of photos I took in southern Anhui. I use transfer film paper to print my photos and take the hand sanitizer as dye. I use a roller to brush the hand sanitizer to transfer the photos to watercolor paper with good water absorption. I like this kind of experimental transfer printing process. From brushing and pressing the hand sanitizer to uncovering the transfer film with sparkling textured printing process. From brushing and pressing the hand sanitizer to uncovering the transfer film with sparkling textured quality, I feel I was in part of the childhood of my father generation, reproducing and resharping their past days and trying to reach out another world.</p>
