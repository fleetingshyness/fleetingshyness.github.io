<h2> Daily Absurdity </h2>
<p> On September 9, 2018, a catastrophe attacked our family. Dad was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment because of sudden cardiac arrest. As his vital signs had already disappeared before he was delivered to the hospital (e.g. no pulse, pupil dilation), the doctor immediately claimed that there was no hope of cure and wanted to persuade our family to give up. However, due to the repeated insistance of our family, after several rounds of rescue, Dad finally made it. However, because Dad's brain had been anoxic for more than an hour, according to past clinical experience, the doctor insisted that Dad might have fallen into brain death, and again persuaded us to give him up. However, brain death needs to meet three preconditions, one of which is that the patient does not breathe autonomously, that is, the patient completely relies on a respirator for breathing. However, after the rescue, Dad had not only recovered his autonomous heartbeat, but also had resumed his autonomous breathing. I challenged the doctors, but they set aside my doubts, explaining that the brain would usually die after it remained anoxic for more than 30 minutes. Their application of bookish experience to rescue and their stubborn adherence to theory became absurd to me all of a sudden. A few days later, Dad recovered mascara reflex (the second most important sign of life distinct from brain death) and the doctor solemnly announced to us that Dad was definitely not brain-dead. It seemed to me that they had overturned their previous judgment, and had acquired a deeper sense that it was a routine to make mistakes. Absurdity, as a seemingly "extraordinary" presence, is nothing more than a daily occurrence in our lives. I want to use a group of photos, mainly based on this experience in the hospital, and in the example of doctor erring, to reflect the routine of making mistakes in our life.</p>
